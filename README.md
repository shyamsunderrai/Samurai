1. Magic number - A small program to have a magic number in a variable and prompt the user to key in the magic number, until then the program keeps running. 
                  Range for the number is between 0-9. My example "magicnumber.py"
                  
2. Age in Seconds/Days - Program to convert days in seconds OR days. NOTE: The input for days "d" or seconds "s" should be supplied within double quotes.
